#### Description of game
This is a Blakjack online card game. It will allow a player to play against a dealer. The game ends with the first to get to 10 wins. This game uses one deck of cards for play.

##### Rules
The player tries to beat the dealer by getting 21 or getting a hand that is higher than the dealer without going over 21. If there is a tie (push) then no one wins that hand.  BlackjacK (an ace with a face card or 10) beats a multi card 21.

##### Instructions

The player then can choose to Hit or Hold.
    Should the player get an ace, they can change the value from One to Eleven or vise versa as they want using the buttons.

The player has to click the Hold button when they are satisfied with their hand.
Next, it's the dealer's turn. The dealer can hit until they have a hand that is at minumum of 17.

The cards in each hand are compared to determine a winner of that hand and that is logged in the "Wins" box for the respective wnnner.

To deal a new hand, click on "New Hand" button and then the "Deal" button.

The winner is the first to get to 10 wins.
